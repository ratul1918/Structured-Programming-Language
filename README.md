gcc -o output_name program_name.c
```

### Run a Program
```bash
./output_name
```

### Example
```bash
gcc -o pattern pattern3.c
./pattern
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through these programs, you will understand:

1. **Fundamentals** - Basic syntax and program structure
2. **Data Structures** - Arrays, structures, and their operations
3. **Functions** - Modular programming and code reusability
4. **Pointers** - Memory management and advanced data handling
5. **File I/O** - Reading and writing files in different modes
6. **Algorithms** - Basic algorithmic thinking and problem-solving

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Start with Basics** - Begin from simple programs before moving to complex ones
2. **Understand Before Running** - Read and understand code before execution
3. **Modify and Experiment** - Try modifying programs to understand different behaviors
4. **Practice Regularly** - Consistent practice improves programming skills
5. **Debug Systematically** - Use printf statements to trace execution

## 📂 File Naming Convention

- Programs are organized by topic in numbered directories (01_, 02_, etc.)
- Each program has both compiled executable (no extension) and source (.c) files
- Assignments are grouped in dedicated folders

## 🔍 Notes

- This repository contains course assignments and practice problems
- Each program is self-contained and demonstrates specific concepts
- Programs are at beginner to intermediate level
- Some advanced topics like pointers and structures are included

## 👨‍💻 Author Notes
